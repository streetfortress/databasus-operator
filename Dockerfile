# Build. The builder stage runs on $BUILDPLATFORM and cross-compiles to
# $TARGETOS/$TARGETARCH, so a multi-arch build (release.yml builds amd64 and
# arm64) needs no QEMU: the Go toolchain does the cross-compile itself, and
# CGO_ENABLED=0 keeps that free of a cross C toolchain. A plain
# `make docker-build` sets both platforms to the host and still gets a native
# binary. GOARCH takes no default, so an unset TARGETARCH also means the host.
